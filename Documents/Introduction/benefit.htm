        <h1>Why Use EngineerMate?</h1>
	    <h3>Easier</h3>	
	    <p>We all know how hard and time-consuming when we need to figure out something by calculating with a formula, or looking up into a 
	    thousand-page handbook with tables and 
            <a href="../../Hydraulics/AnyFluid/pics/moody-diagram.png">charts</a>. Using <a href="../../Hydraulics/SimplePipeLine/pics/Hazen_SI.jpg">Hazen-Williams formula</a> is an example, while using <a href="../../Hydraulics/AnyFluid/pics/Darcy01.jpg">Darcy's formula</a> and <a href="../../Hydraulics/AnyFluid/pics/Darcy01b.jpg">Colebrook equation</a> is even harder. </p>
        
	    <p>EngineerMate is trying every effort to alleviate your task. </p>	

	    <h3>Faster</h3>	
	    <p>EngineerMate lets your computer do calculations, even system design, for you with 
            various tools so that you can do more things with much less time. </p>		
    	
	    <h3>Simpler</h3>
	    <p>You will not need a 
            <a href="pics/library-header.jpg"> big library</a> as used to be. While most manufacturers provide 
            more and more web sites to replace classic catalog books, EngineerMate makes your <a href="pics/DeskTop.jpg">real desk</a> top much clearer by making full use of the one on your computer screen.</p>
	    <p>Wherever you be - during your business trip, field visit, building inspection,..., you can do your job with your lab top.</p>
    	
	    <h3>Better</h3>		
	    <p>You can design your project with calculations more scientifically, systematically, accurately and efficiently.</p>
