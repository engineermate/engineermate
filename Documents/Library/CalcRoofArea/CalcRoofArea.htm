            <h3>Overcoming Code Challenges</h3>
            <h1>
                Calculating Roof Area for Roof Drain Sizing</h1>
            By Anjian Lu, CPD
            <h2>
                THE DILEMMA</h2>
            <p>
                Plumbing engineers often work on projects that, because of location, are governed
                by different plumbing codes. Variations among the codes sometimes cause confusion
                and present challenges either within the design group or between the designer and
                the plan reviewer or inspector. The roof area calculation for sizing roof drains
                is an example of how differences among the codes can challenge the designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                We all agree that vertical walls contribute flow to roof drains because they collect
                rainwater when wind driven rain hits and runs down the wall. How do vertical walls
                affect the sizing of roof drains? The codes differ in their answers to this question.
            </p>
            <h2>
                CODE SEARCH</h2>
            <p>
                A search of the national codes found the following references to calculation of
                roof area for sizing roof drains.</p>
            <h3>
                National Standard Plumbing Code (NSPC)</h3>
            <p>
                <b>13.1.10.3 Vertical Walls:</b> Where vertical walls drain onto roofs, an allowance
                based on 50 percent of the maximum projected wall area shall be added to the roof
                area onto which each wall drains.
            </p>
            <h3>
                International Plumbing Code (IPC)</h3>
            <p>
                <b>1106.4 Vertical Walls:</b> In sizing roof drains and storm drainage piping, one-half
                of the area of any vertical wall that diverts rainwater to the roof shall be added
                to the projected roof area for inclusion in calculating the required size of vertical
                conductors, leaders, and horizontal storm drainage piping.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC)</h3>
            <p>
                <b>1106.4 Side Walls Draining onto a Roof:</b> Where vertical walls project above
                a roof so as to permit storm water to drain to the roof area below, the adjacent
                roof area may be computed from Table 11-1 as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>For one wall, add 50 percent of the wall area to the roof area figures.</li>
                <li>For two adjacent walls, add 35 percent of the total wall areas.</li>
                <li>For two opposite walls of the same height, add no additional area.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As you can see, NSPC requires 50 percent of the maximum projected wall area to be
                added to roof area calculation.However, the designer has to project the wall area
                in different directions and take the maximum area.
            </p>
            <p>
                IPC tells you to add one-half of the area of any wall that diverts rainwater to
                the roof, to the roof area. Here, any means all.
            </p>
            <p>
                UPC&#8217;s guideline is much more clear and executable. I&#8217;ll explain why
                UPC set the table this way.
            </p>
            <h2>
                GEOMETRY IN ROOF AREA CALCULATIONS</h2>
            <p>
                First, rainfall density is measured by a rain gauge (See Figure 2), which consists of three parts:
                a cylindrical overflow tube, a funnel on top, and a measuring tube underneath the
                funnel. The funnel diverts water into the measuring tube, which is one-tenth of
                the area of the funnel top for more accurate reading. The overflow tube stores water
                when the measuring tube is full and overflows. Now, imagine that the funnel top
                is a part of the roof.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let&#8217;s look at a real roof as an example.</p>
   
            <p>
                Figure 1 shows a simple roof with projected high roofs. The four roof drains in
                this roof are A, B, C, and D. Roof drains A and C are the same and have two perpendicular
                walls. Roof drain D has one vertical wall, and roof drain B has two opposite walls.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                Suppose rain hits the wall in angle &#945;. We then can draw a triangle abd. Its
                three sides are ad, dc and ca. We express their length with an upper score in the
                functions to follow.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                Let&#8217;s look at the horizontal roof draining to roof drain C first. If the wall
                length is L<sub>C</sub> and the area is A<sub>CH</sub>, then
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the plumbing code requires use 50% of the wall area, i.e., Hv = (1/2)H, then</p>
                <div class="formula"><img src="pics/EQ_08.png" alt="" /></div>

            </table> 
            <p>
                Now, what about the wall north of roof drain C? If there is no wall on the west,
                the answer is as simple as taking one-half of the area of the wall since wind direction
                is unpredictable.
            </p>
            <p>
                UPC suggests using 35 percent of the total area of both walls. In most situations,
                this is reasonable because rain hits both walls in 45<sup>o </sup>angle, i.e., Hv
                = (1/2)H x sin(45) = 0.5x0.707 = 0.3536 or 35%. However, if one of the walls is
                much larger than the other, the drain may be undersized. On the other hand, if you
                take the 50 percent of the total area, the drain may be oversized. For this reason,
                the NSPC&#8217;s guideline, which requires using 50 percent of the maximum projected
                area, may be the best solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for areas with opposite walls, such as the area for roof drain B, UPC&#8217;s
                guideline No. 3 of adding no additional area to the calculation is adequate. However,
                if the two walls are not of the same size, the difference between the two areas
                should be added. As you can see from Figure 2, the funnel of the rain gauge can
                be considered as a round 360-degree wall in the periphery of the building roof.
                The rainwater recorders do not take the roof geometry into account, so we, as engineers,
                should.

            <h2>
                SUGGESTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the analysis above, I offer the following suggestions for your consideration.</p>
            <b>For Single Roof Drains</b>
            <p>
                For single vertical walls affecting the collection area of a roof drain, add 50
                percent of the side area to the total for calculating the flow rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                For single curved vertical walls, use 50 percent of the maximum projected area.
            </p>
            <p>
                For multiple walls, use 50 percent of the maximum projected area of all walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                For drain areas between two opposite walls, add no additional area. If the area
                of each wall is not the same, add 50 percent of the difference between the two areas.
            </p>
            <b>For Horizontal Pipes or Leaders Receiving Two or More Roof Drains</b>
            <p>
                Take only 50 percent of one maximum total projected side area of the walls in one
                direction.
            </p>
            <b>For the Whole Roof of a Building</b>
            <p>
                Do not add any side wall area except when the projected wall area is falling off
                the roof boundary. To decide this, use the architectural elevation drawing to draw
                a 63-degree line starting from the top of the highest wall (the hypotenuse of a
                right triangle with bottom length of 1 and height of 2). Add 100 percent of the
                horizontal area falling off the roof boundary to the total horizontal roof area
                for sizing the building rainwater drain.
            </p>
            <b>For Riser Diagrams </b>
            <p>
                We may not have to put the exact arithmetic sum of the branches to a main or submain.
                This is because when a wall may affect one part of the piping, it may not affect
                the downstream part as mentioned above.
            </p>
            <h2>
                CONCLUSIONS</h2>
            <p>
                While properly sizing the roof drainage system is very important for structural
                safety, calculating roof area can not be overlooked. A uniform method in all the
                plumbing codes nationwide is a request from the plumbing engineers like me.
            </p>
            <p>
                With 3D MEP AutoCad or Revit increasing in popularity, it should be not difficult
                to determine the correct projected area for sizing the rainwater system&#8212;the
                roof drains, leaders, gutters, downspouts, and horizontal piping.
