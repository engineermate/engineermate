        <p>Incentives for sprinkler installations in new U.S. homes are becoming increasingly common due to building codes and ordinances and in recognition of the life safety benefits these systems provide, according to "<a href="http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/PDF/Research/RFIncentivesResidentialFireSprinklers.pdf"> Incentives for the Use of Residential Fire Sprinkler Systems in the U.S. </a>" This second part to a <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/PDF/Research/FireSprinklerCostAssessment.pdf" >study released in 2008</a> finds that a representative selection of builder-oriented incentives could offset approximately one-third of the cost of a sprinkler system for a new home; incentives expected to accrue to builders were found to have the largest estimated value, totaling $1,949 per building lot; developer-oriented incentives were estimated to offer a value of $1,271 per lot; and incentives relating to homeowners were lower, with a total first-year value of $145 per lot.</p>

        <p>A delivery driver mistakenly dumped 20 tons of aluminum sulphate into the wrong tank at a water treatment works, causing Britain's worst mass poisoning, according to a Daily Mail <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325747/Driver-admits-poisoned-water-supply-20k-homes-Camelford.html" >article</a>. His error affected water supplied to about 20,000 homes, causing rashes, diarrhea, mouth ulcers, and other health problems.</p>

        <p>Implementing low-impact development practices that emphasize rainwater harvesting-which includes infiltration of water into the ground as well as capture in rain barrels or cisterns for later use on site-at new and redeveloped residential and commercial properties in the urbanized areas of Southern California and limited portions of the San Francisco Bay area has the potential to increase local water supplies by up to 405,000 acre-feet of water per year by 2030, according to "<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/water/lid/files/lid.pdf" >A Clear Blue Future</a>" by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the University of California, Santa Barbara. This volume represents roughly two-thirds of the volume of water used by the entire City of Los Angeles each year.</p>

        <p>The city of Aurora, Colorado recently celebrated the completion of the <a href="http://www.prairiewaters.org/" >Prairie Waters Project</a>, an innovative and environmentally friendly water system that was finished ahead of schedule and more than $100 million under budget. The system includes 34 miles of 60-inch diameter pipeline, three pump stations, a natural purification area, and a new water treatment facility that is one of the most technologically advanced in the country. The project begins in Brighton, where water is pulled from the South Platte River. Riverbank wells pull the water through sand and gravel to perform the initial cleaning process, and water then is pumped to Aurora, where it is treated with multiple water purification steps, including an advanced ultraviolet oxidation process that is among the largest application of UV oxidation in the world. The plant can treat 50 million gallons of water each day.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.saws.org/latest_news/NewsDrill.cfm?news_id=709" >Dos Rios Water Recycling Center</a> in San Antonio, Texas is the first sustainable project of its kind in the nation, capturing biogas generated during the sewage treatment process and selling it through a commercial gas pipeline. Methane gas is generated by biosolids during the sewage treatment process, and San Antonio Water System previously burned off the gas using flares. Now the gas will be treated and transferred to a nearby commercial gas pipeline, where they will sell it on the open market. In return, ratepayers will receive a royalty on the sale of the gas, estimated at $200,000 a year, reducing the cost of operations and keeping rates affordable.</p>

        <p>American voters say that water is the most important service they receive, and the majority of both voters and businesses are willing to pay more in water bills to upgrade water systems, according to "<a href="http://www.itt.com/valueofwater/water_survey.htm" >Value of Water Survey</a>."</p>

        <p>Through a funding contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1 (2007): Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-rise Residential Buildings is being offered as a <a href="http://www.ashrae.org/standard901-2007-free" >free downloadable PDF</a>.</p>
