            <h4 id='奥巴马总统签署减铅法律'>奥巴马总统签署减铅法律</h4>
            <p>On January 4, the president signed the “<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111s3874enr/pdf/BILLS-111s3874enr.pdf">Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act</a>,” which will take effect Jan. 4, 2014. This legislation amends the Safe Drinking Water Act’s definition of lead-free and limits the maximum content of lead in plumbing devices to 0.25 percent.

            <p>In response to emerging scientific evidence that chromium-polluted tap water could pose health risks if consumed over long periods, the U.S. EPA has issued <a href="http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/chromium/guidance.cfm">guidance</a> recommending how public water systems might enhance monitoring and sampling programs specifically for hexavalent chromium (the “Erin Brockovich” chemical).</p>

            <p>A comprehensive Clean Water Act “<a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-enrd-1472.html">settlement</a> with the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District will address the flow of untreated sewage into Cleveland area waterways and Lake Erie, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Due to the terms of the settlement, which incorporates green infrastructure and major combined sewer overflow control measures, more than 98 percent of wet weather flows entering the combined sewer system will be captured and treated.</p>

            <p>Since the <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/plumbing_products.html">federal regulation for energy conservation in consumer plumbing products</a> is based on outdated standards, the U.S. Department of Energy has waived the general rule of federal preemption for energy-conservation standards regarding any state regulation concerning the water use or water efficiency of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals. This waiver allows states to set higher efficiency standards for these products than the current federal regulations.</p>
            <h4 id='北乔治亚州采用更多的节水规定'>北乔治亚州采用更多的节水规定</h4>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.northgeorgiawater.com/">Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District</a>, which oversees water systems in 15 northern Georgia counties, recently implemented new water-conservation measures that include toilet rebates for multifamily buildings, the installation of meters with point-of-use leak detection, metering of private fire lines, expedited leak-reduction programs, and expanded outreach and education. The regulations could reduce water consumption by 30 million gallons a day over the next several decades. While consumers will pay for the improvements in their water bills, costs will be phased in over the next 30 years.</p>
            <h4 id='污水中存在的能量比您想象的要多'>污水中存在的能量比您想象的要多</h4>
            <p>If the energy from the waste produced by everyone in the world were harnessed, a continuous supply rate of 70-140 gigawatts of energy per year would be produced, the equivalent of burning 52-104 million tons of oil in a modern power station or up to 24,000 of the world largest wind turbines working continuously, according to “Determination of the Internal Chemical Energy of Wastewater.” Put another way, 1 gallon of wastewater contains enough energy to power a 100-watt light bulb for five minutes.</p>
            <h4 id='何为适量的氟化物？'>何为适量的氟化物？</h4>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed lowering the amount of fluoride in drinking water to balance the benefits of preventing tooth decay while limiting any unwanted health effects from dental fluorosis, which may occur with excess fluoride consumption during the tooth-forming years and appears mostly as lacy white markings or spots on the enamel. The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/01/pre_pub_frn_fluoride.html">recommendation</a> is to decrease the amount of fluoride to 0.7 milligram per liter from the current recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter.</p>

            <p>While design measures to prevent Legionella bacteria growth are routinely implemented in hospitals, they also should be used in common water systems in commercial and industrial workplaces where conditions are ideal for bacteria growth, according to an <a href="http://safety.blr.com/workplace-safety-news/employee-health/employee-health/Common-Water-Systems-At-Risk-of-LDB-Contamination/">article</a> on Safety.BLR.com. These include fire sprinkler systems and eye washes or safety showers where water may grow stagnant from lack of use.</p>
