            <p>Of the world's 500 largest companies, 39 percent report detrimental impacts from water issues ranging from disruption to operations from drought or flooding (in one case resulting in $100 million in remediation costs), declining water quality necessitating costly on-site pre-treatment, increases in water prices, and fines and litigation relating to pollution incidents, according to "<a href="https://www.cdproject.net/CDPResults/CDP-2010-Water-Disclosure-Global-Report.pdf">The Case for Water Disclosure</a>." On the positive side, 62 percent of corporations have identified a wide range of water-related business opportunities in areas such as water management, water efficiency and reduction, and wastewater treatment.</p>

            <p>The new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsI1dov9Xbw">Dynamic Fuels plant </a>in Geismar, Louisiana, is successfully converting non-food grade animal fats produced or procured by Tyson Foods, such as beef tallow, pork lard, chicken fat, and greases, into high-quality renewable fuels. The plant can produce 2,500 barrels per day of renewable diesel with a cloud point as low as -26°F and cetane as high as 88, more than twice that of the ASTM petroleum diesel specification. The facility's renewable diesel fuel product meets all ASTM D975 specifications for diesel fuel. </p>

            <p>A City of Chicago plumbing inspector-who once received a $9,000 cash bribe in a restaurant parking lot to overlook plumbing code violations at a condo development-was sentenced to 41 months in jail earlier this month, according to an <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/cityhall/2869080,plumbing-inspector-payoff-110510.article">article</a> in the Chicago Sun-Times. He was originally arrested in a federal corruption case known as "Operation Crooked Code."</p>

            <p>The Levi's brand recently announced its new <a href="http://www.us.levi.com/emails/?gclid=COfMyIHno6UCFYNqKgodr36SIA">Water &lt& Less jeans</a>-manufactured using significantly less water than the average pair of jeans, which requires 11.1 gallons (42 liters) of water in the finishing process. The Water &lt Less collection reduces water consumption by an average of 28 percent and up to 96 percent for some new products in the line.</p>

            <p>Based on an undercover operation, the U.S. EPA has proposed a $30,000 penalty against a Fall River, Massachusetts plumbing and supply company charged with selling ozone-depleting refrigerants in violation of the Clean Air Act, according to an <a href="http://ohsonline.com/articles/2010/11/07/plumbing-company-penalized-for-illegal-sales-of-refrigerant.aspx?admgarea=news">article</a> in Occupational Health & Safety. EPA regulations restrict the sale of ozone-depleting refrigerant to persons who are trained and certified, or otherwise properly regulated, to limit illegal releases that would further damage the stratospheric ozone layer. Last summer, an undercover EPA inspector who is not a certified technician was able to purchase refrigerant at two of the company's outlets.</p>

            <p>The key economies of Australia, India, China, and the United States all have massive "extreme risk" areas of water stress, where demand exceeds 80 percent of total renewable water resources, according to the Water Stress Index by global risks advisory firm Maplecroft. The Great Plains and the Southwest are suffering severely due to intensive farming and low precipitation. For instance, in Texas, 266,579 square miles (690,438 square kilometers) are subject to extreme water stress, equal to 7.27 percent of the state's land mass. In the West, groundwater is being consumed faster than it is being replenished, and groundwater tables are steadily falling. The Colorado River often runs dry before reaching the sea. The river now serves 30 million people in seven U.S. states and Mexico, with 70 percent or more of its water siphoned off for irrigation.</p>

            <p>Although commercial gas water heater shipments decreased 9 percent in September 2010, to 5,658 units, compared with 6,199 units shipped in September 2009, year-to-date U.S. shipments of commercial gas water heaters increased 5 percent, to 60,491 units, compared with 57,500 units shipped during the same period in 2009, according to the Air-conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute. Commercial electric water heater shipments increased 2 percent in September 2010, to 5,021 units, up from 4,948 units shipped in September 2009, and year-to-date commercial electric water heater shipments increased 4 percent to 44,856 units, up from 43,165 units shipped during the same period in 2009. </p>

            <p>The next edition of the Canadian National Building Code will be available November 29. Click <a href="http://www.nationalcodes.ca/eng/2010_codes_significant_changes.shtml">here</a> for a summary of significant technical changes. Of interest to plumbing engineers is the Water Pipe Sizing section. Pipe sizing requirements were updated to accommodate the current standard practice of using water-conserving appliances and fixtures.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Green Building Council has opened the proposed update to the LEED green building rating system for its first <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=2360">public comment</a>. The public comment period will close on December 31, 2010. The proposed update builds on the foundation of LEED 2009, including the alignment and weighting of credits and further advances the "bookshelf" framework where credits are applied to specific building types. The update also places increased emphasis on integrated process and building performance.</p>
