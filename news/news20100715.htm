<h4 id='联合国在考虑全球人类对给水和生活污水排水的权利'>联合国在考虑全球人类对给水和生活污水排水的权利</h4>
    <p>Last month, Pablo Solon, the Bolivian ambassador to the United Nations, presented a 
    <a href="http://www.blueplanetproject.net/RightToWater/UNDraftresolution.pdf"> draft resolution</a>  
    declaring the human right to “available, safe, acceptable, accessible and affordable water and sanitation” 
    to a closed-door consultation at the UN General Assembly. The resolution currently is being further developed 
    by member states, with the final text to be presented to the president of the General Assembly for tabling near 
    the end of July.</p>
<h4 id=' 美国消防协会颁布有关住宅喷淋系统冰冻的安全警告'> 美国消防协会颁布有关住宅喷淋系统冰冻的安全警告</h4>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) issued a 
    <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/NFPA_Safety_Alert_on_Antifreeze_July_2010.pdf"> safety alert</a> 
    recommending that residential fire sprinkler systems containing antifreeze should be drained and the antifreeze 
    replaced with water. The alert follows a research study and an initial set of fire tests conducted after a fire 
    incident raised concerns about antifreeze solutions in residential sprinkler systems. The incident involved a 
    grease fire in a kitchen where a sprinkler with a high concentration of antifreeze deployed. The fire resulted 
    in a single fatality and serious injury to another person.</p>
<h4 id=' 纽约市希望无线水表可以帮助居民节水'> 纽约市希望无线水表可以帮助居民节水</h4>
    <p>The New York City Department of Environmental Protection has launched a new system for real-time, online water use 
    and bill tracking for homeowners and businesses, which will allow water customers to analyze their water use and 
    identify ways to conserve water, reduce water bills, and detect leaks. The tool is the latest component of the 
    citywide conversion to automated meter reading. Activation will be phased in by borough, and all water customers 
    in New York City are expected to have wireless meters and real-time, online access to their water bills by January 2012.</p>

    <p>According to an 
    <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=393438">article </a>  
    in the Daily Herald, the Illinois Department of Public Health, which oversees the state plumbing code, granted approval for 
    the Lake County Forest Preserve District to proceed with a plan to use rainwater to power five toilets and two urinals in 
    the public restrooms at the Ryerson Woods Welcome Center in Deerfield―a plan the District has been pursuing for four years. 
    Harvesting and reusing rainwater is not prohibited in the state plumbing code, but the code does not define where harvested 
    rainwater can be used. Thus, projects must be approved on a case-by-case basis. Legislation allowing the installation of 
    such systems in a consistent manner anywhere in the state was introduced in the state Senate in January, but it was shelved 
    in the House due to issues regarding the bill’s language.</p>

    <p>An Emory University  
    <a href="http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action;jsessionid=60B5BF570336125B74054A9FCCB4CA67?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.1001939"> study</a> 
    finds that sewage overflowing into urban creeks and streams during periods of heavy rain can promote the spread of 
    West Nile virus. The study analyzed six years of data, which showed that people living near creeks with sewage overflows 
    in lower-income neighborhoods of Southeast Atlanta had a seven times higher risk for West Nile virus than the rest of the 
    city. Mosquitoes and birds near seven CSO facilities and associated streams had significantly higher rates of West Nile 
    virus infection than those near urban creeks not affected by CSOs.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_waterless_urinal/"> “Pissing Match: Is the World Ready for the Waterless Urinal?” </a> 
    in the July 2010 issue of Wired magazine describes the introduction of the waterless urinal in the United States and how 
    one manufacturer pursued its adoption in the model plumbing codes against strong opposition from plumbing unions.</p>

    <p>In the Port of Portland building in Oregon, a system called a Living Machine uses plants and microorganisms to filter 
    wastewater to be reused to flush toilets and for other nonpotable uses. The Eden Project in Cornwall, England, is covered 
    with pillows of ETFE that can be inflated or deflated to adjust the level of insulation according to the outside temperature. 
    At the Chartwell School in Seaside, California, a 9,000-gallon cistern condenses and collects fog and rainwater for use in 
    irrigation and to flush toilets. Click

    <p>According to an <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/a-citys-motto-i-heart-tap-water/"> article </a>  
    in The New York Times, in an effort to promote its high-quality drinking water as a sustainable alternative to bottled water, 
    New York City’s Environmental Protection Department has developed a product line of merchandise bearing the NYC Water logo. 
    The line includes coasters, water bottles, glassware, and t-shirts, among other products, and all proceeds benefit the City of New York.</p>

    <p>While green buildings offer enormous environmental benefits, the rapid growth in sustainable construction has led to 
    buildings being constructed without proper planning and experience, causing failure in some cases. An 
    <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/Local/Article/20187/78/194/How_to_use_insurance_to_handle_the_risks_of_building_to_LEED_standards.aspx?page=2"> article </a>  in Philadelphia Smart Business explains how insurance companies are developing special policies for property owners to insure against damage caused by faulty systems or the loss of income due to the time needed during construction to gain LEED certification.</p>
<h4 id=' WaterSense产品2009年帮助节省了360亿加仑的水'> WaterSense产品2009年帮助节省了360亿加仑的水</h4>
    <p>Last year, the WaterSense program helped consumers save more than 36 billion gallons of water and $267 million on their water 
    and sewer bills, nearly four times more than they saved with WaterSense-labeled toilets, faucets, and faucet accessories in 2008.  
    WaterSense products also were responsible for conserving 4.9 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 1.7 million metric tons of 
    carbon dioxide. Click

    to read more about the program’s progress since its inception in 2006.</p>
    <p> In related news, EPA and WaterSense recently kicked off a 
    <a href="http://www.epa.gov/watersense/wereforwater">“We’re for Water” </a>  
    campaign to encourage Americans to make simple choices that save water, such as checking for leaks and replacing faucets and showerheads with more efficient models.</p>
