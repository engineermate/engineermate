            <p>Although PEX became part of the California Plumbing Code in August 2009, the action was repealed due to a lawsuit brought by the Coalition for Safe Building Materials against the California Building Standards Commission. However, this month the Commission once again approved the use of PEX in hospitals, clinics, schools, residences, and commercial structures, effective January 1, 2011 for the 2010 California Plumbing Code. The Commission reinstated PEX with the caveats that underground PEX must be sleeved, the material must stand up to recirculating hot water, the fittings won’t de-zincify, and PEX systems must be filled and flushed. Learn more about the situation in this <a href="http://contractormag.com/news/california-pex-plumbing-1234/">article </a>from Contractor Magazine.</p>

            <p><a href=http://construction.com/market_research/FreeReport/GreenBIM/>Green BIM: How Building Information Modeling Is Contributing to Green Design and Construction </a>argues that a sharp increase in BIM modeling for green construction will occur in the next few years, despite the fact that only 17 percent of Green BIM practitioners are currently realizing more than 50 percent of BIM’s potential for their green goals. According to the study, 78 percent of survey respondents who aren’t using BIM on green building projects now plan to do so in the next three years.</p>
            <h4 id='PVC管道制造商第二次被起诉'>PVC管道制造商第二次被起诉</h4>
            <p>On Tuesday, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California on behalf of private water utilities and commercial property owners potentially seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from JM Eagle for knowingly supplying substandard PVC pipe, particularly that the pipe was below the minimum strength required by applicable industry standards. The lawsuit also alleges that the manufacturer cherry-picked pipe samples for testing by outside certification agencies, while continuing to use a cheaper manufacturing process that produced weaker pipes, but increased profits. The current lawsuit includes claimants who were not part of the whistle-blower lawsuit that was unsealed last February.</p>

            <p>A type of algae nicknamed “rock snot" because of its slippery appearance is infesting the Bear River and causing problems for the Placer County Water Agency, located northeast of Sacramento, because the algae clogs screens and filter beds, decreasing treatment efficiency and increasing water and energy use and costs. The algae can reduce filter runs as much as 20-30 hours and is forcing the utility to backwash filters around the clock in hot weather, which means the utility is purchasing energy at peak costs and using 25 percent more water to remove the algae from the filter media. According to an  <a href=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/08/30/2991654/disgusting-algaes-spread-perplexes.html>article </a>in the Sacramento Bee, the algae’s potential effects on the environment, recreation, and plumbing are so severe that New Zealand recently adopted penalties of five years in prison and a $100,000 fine for anyone intentionally transporting it.</p>

            <p>On Sept. 21, county commissioners in Worcester County, Maryland, will hold a  <a href="http://www.co.worcester.md.us/commissioners/publichearings/2010/Fire_Sprinklers_2010.pdf">public hearing </a>to discuss the requirement for the installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems in townhouses and one- and two-family dwellings constructed after January 1, 2011. The requirement is contained in the 2009 International Residential Code as incorporated in the Maryland Building Performance Standards, which became effective in all local jurisdictions as of July 1, 2010. However, the Code of Maryland Regulations allows local governments to modify the provisions of the Maryland Building Performance Standards to address conditions peculiar to the local jurisdiction. </p>

            <p>Reduced nutrients from wastewater treatment plants and improved water clarity have increased the abundance and diversity of submerged aquatic vegetation in the Potomac River, according to the results of an 18-year  <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/08/31/1003590107">study </a>by the U.S. Geological Survey and England’s National Oceanography Centre. Since 1990, the area covered by submerged aquatic vegetation in the lower Potomac has doubled, the area covered by native vegetation has increased ten-fold, the diversity of plant species has increased, and the proportion of exotic species to native species has declined as nutrients have declined, in part due to reductions in nitrogen effluent entering the river from the wastewater treatment plant for the Washington, D.C. area.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released a draft of  <a href="http://oaspub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=498020">Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments: Four Case Studies of Water Utility Practices</a>, which details the types of analyses, models, and climate change information being developed and used by four utilities that are leaders in climate adaptation to understand and respond to climate risk. In other climate change news, an <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=los-angeles-adapt-to-climate-change">article</a> on Scientific American.com, taken from the book Climatopolis, explains how Los Angeles will have to re-evaluate its water use and distribution in the coming years due to decreasing natural water supplies.</p>

            <p>The National Groundwater Association’s  <a href="http://ngwa.org/public/PYGD/pygd.aspx">Protect Your Groundwater Day</a> was created to urge consumers to take simple steps to help protect their water sources. The website offers suggestions on how people can both conserve water and prevent contamination from household sources such as cleaning products and fertilizers, such as checking for leaks, installing rain barrels, and not pouring chemicals and medications down drains.</p>

            <p>In partnership with the Canadian Hydronics Council, Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario has launched two certificate programs: Hydronics Designer and Hydronics Installer. The program consists of four modules of 60 hours each and starts October 15.
