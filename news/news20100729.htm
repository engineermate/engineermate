<p>More than 1,100 U.S. counties―one-third of all counties in the lower 48 states―face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming, and more than 400 of these counties will be at extremely high risk for water shortages, based on estimates from a new report by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The report finds that 14 states face an extreme or high risk to water sustainability or are likely to see limitations on water availability as demand exceeds supply by 2050. In the Great Plains and Southwest United States in particular, water sustainability is at extreme risk. Click <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/watersustainability/">here </a>for more results and county- and state-specific maps detailing the report’s findings.</p>
<h4 id='伊利诺州州长签署改善防火安全的法令'>伊利诺州州长签署改善防火安全的法令</h4>
<p>On Tuesday, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a bill into law that requires fraternity and sorority housing in Illinois to install automatic fire sprinkler systems. House Bill 5664 requires fraternities and sororities built after Jan. 1, 2011 to have an automatic fire sprinkler system. Any fraternity or sorority that does not comply with the new law will not be allowed to occupy its housing facility. Fraternity and sorority houses built before Jan. 1, 2011 will have until Jan. 1, 2019 to install an automatic fire sprinkler system.</p>

<p>Due to severe pollution, less than 50 percent of China’s surface water is undrinkable, and one-quarter is completely unusable, even for industrial purposes, according to China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection. The pollution is primarily industrial waste from paper mills, cement factories, and chemical plants, as well as overuse of fertilizers.</p>

<p>Hospitalizations for three common waterborne diseases―Legionnaires' disease, cryptosporidiosis, and giardiasis―cost the U.S. healthcare system as much as $539 million annually, according to research presented at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases. Inpatient hospitalization costs per case averaged more than $34,000 for Legionnaires' disease, approximately $9,000 for giardiasis, and more than $21,000 for cryptosporidiosis. Ways to prevent these diseases and lower healthcare costs include appropriate maintenance of building water systems and regular inspection of pools and other recreational water facilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nawc.org/waterisyourbusiness/"> “Water Is Your Business</a>,” created by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Water Companies, is a new series of local events to educate public leaders, business owners, and residents on the importance of water infrastructure to public and environmental health and the economic vitality of communities. The events will focus on the economic and ecological impacts of water provision, use, and disposal.</p>
<h4 id='加拿大公布了大便器和小便器使用回收水的规范'>加拿大公布了大便器和小便器使用回收水的规范</h4>
<p>Health Canada and the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating have released a new <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/water-eau/reclaimed_water-eaux_recyclees/reclaimed_water-eaux_recyclees-eng.pdf"> guideline</a> designed to support CSA B128: Design, Installation and Maintenance of Nonpotable Water Systems. The guideline was created to ensure that the use of reclaimed water does not pose a health risk due to the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and some chemicals in residential wastewater, which may be dangerous if the wastewater is improperly treated or if it is used for purposes other than toilet or urinal flushing.</p>

<p>North Carolina State University researchers have developed a computer model that will accurately predict storm water pollution impacts from proposed real-estate developments, allowing regulators to make informed decisions about which development projects can be approved without endangering water quality. The model is designed to evaluate the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus found in storm water runoff from residential and commercial developments.

<p>A team of “flushers” was drafted to help shovel 1,000 tons of oily solid waste that had blocked a sewer underneath Leicester Square in London, causing a flooding and sewer spill threat. The 4-foot-thick wall of fat could fill nine London double-decker buses.

<h4 id='遵守规范！'>遵守规范！</h4>
<p>Engineers working in jurisdictions other than the one in which they reside are encouraged to consult the local plumbing code to ensure code-compliant designs. Why is this important? While most jurisdictions adopt one of the model plumbing codes, they often make local amendments to the requirements. For instance, in Flagstaff, Arizona, the local plumbing code requires waterless urinals in all commercial installations, new and replacement. Thanks to Kevin Rohde for bringing this to our attention. Do you know of a unique requirement in a local plumbing code? Send it to <a href="mailto:gpienta@aspe.org"> ASPE Pipeline</a> to help educate your peers across the country.</p>
<h4 id='将粪便污水转化成电能'>将粪便污水转化成电能</h4>
<p>A British industrial design student has created a system that transforms falling wastewater into electricity. Called<a href="http://www.creativeboom.co.uk/news/waste-not-want-not-with-dmu-students-electric-idea/">  HyDro Power</a>, the device uses wastewater to power a generator as it falls down a building’s pipes. Designed for the pipes of high-rise buildings rather than individual homes, HyDro Power could offer substantial energy and cost savings, as high as $1,415 per year for an average seven-story building.</p>
