        <p>By a vote of 122 in favor and none against, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution introduced by Bolivia that calls on countries and international organizations to provide financial resources, build capacity, and transfer technology, particularly to developing countries, to help provide safe, clean, accessible, and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all people. The United States delegation abstained from voting due to concerns that the text could undermine the current work of the Human Rights Council because it described the right to water and sanitation in a way not reflected in existing international law. Click <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/ga10967.doc.htm">here</a> to read more about the resolution, including the opinions of countries that spoke during the meeting.</p>

        <p>In Jakarta, the capital and largest city of Indonesia, less than 50 percent of the city’s 9 million citizens have water on tap, and only 3 percent of the city’s homes have proper sewage systems, according to an <a href="http://www.eco-business.com/news/2010/aug/10/jakartas-water-woes/">article</a> in Eco-Business.com. Most citizens must utilize community wells for water, and often in poor neighborhoods a “water mafia” controls the communal tank and charges residents two to three times the normal cost to draw water from it. Unfortunately, the government is not allowing piped water systems to many neighborhoods because residents are living on the land illegally.</p>
        <h4 id='AQUA 用水法已在美国众议院通过'>AQUA 用水法已在美国众议院通过</h4>
        <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed by voice vote <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/documents/20100729/HR5320_RH.pdf">H.R. 5320</a>, the Assistance, Quality, and Affordability (AQUA) Act of 2010, authorizing $4.8 billion over three years for drinking water state revolving fund programs, which provide low-interest loans to communities to build or improve drinking water facilities, as well as $100 million in grants over five years to help small public water systems comply with drinking water regulations. The bill also changes the legal definition of “lead free” for pipes and fixtures from 8 percent lead to 0.25 percent lead in wetted surfaces. The U.S. Senate has similar legislation on which it now must act.</p>

        <p>Hoechst Celanese Corp. has agreed to pay up to $1 million to resolve a class action lawsuit filed in 1999 in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. The lawsuit related to the alleged unsuitability of polybutylene pipes and pipe fittings made from acetal resin, claiming that the pipes leaked and caused major problems in plumbing and radiant heating systems. The allegations have not been proven, and the court did not take any position as to the truth or merits of the claims asserted by either side. The company has denied the allegations and any wrongdoing or liability.</p>

        <p>According to an <a href="http://www.herald-mail.com/?cmd=displaystory&story_id=250732&format=html">article</a> in The Herald-Mail, Washington County, Maryland commissioners voted 4-1 to not require fire sprinkler systems in new single-family or two-family homes as part of a building code update. As adopted, the code requires fire sprinklers only in apartments, townhomes, and commercial buildings. The updated code takes effect September 1.</p>

        <p>According to Dow Jones Newswires, BP could be fined between $5.4 billion and $21 billion if the company is found to be negligent in the oil spill. Based on recent estimates, a total of 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, and under the Clean Water Act, BP could be fined between $1,100 and $4,300 for every barrel of oil that leaked from the well. However, it is unclear if the company will be assessed fines on the 800,000 barrels of oil that it managed to recover.</p>

        <p>Engineers at the University of Maryland have developed a <a href="http://newsdesk.umd.edu/vibrant/release.cfm?ArticleID=2209">bioretention system</a> that enhances the removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, and other urban pollutants from storm water runoff. The new bioretention vegetation and greenery strips contain a layer of special powdered aluminum hydroxide, which helps remove phosphorus from runoff. The system also includes a denitrification basin underneath permeable, porous concrete areas for enhanced nitrogen removal.</p>

        <p>Scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy have developed water quality software that enhances a water system's ability to detect when an intentional or unintentional contamination has occurred. Called <a href="http://www.epa.gov/nhsrc/news/news122007.html">Canary</a>, the software can detect a wide variety of chemical and biological contaminants, including pesticides, metals, and pathogens. It helps distinguish between natural variations in water quality measurements and hazardous contamination and sends an alarm to indicate when water utilities should take steps to investigate and respond to potential contamination. The software is being evaluated for use in four U.S. cities―New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco―and in Singapore.</p>

        <p>According to the results of a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es903241k">study</a> published in Environmental Science and Technology, swimming pool disinfectants have the potential to cause genetic damage to mammalian cells in frequent swimmers. The results suggest that brominating agents should be avoided and that UV treatment combined with chlorine is the best water treatment method.</p>

        <p>In its first month of deployment, <a href="http://www.westernsmartyard.com/">Smart Yard</a>, a community water conservation program launched by the Western Municipal Water District in Riverside, California, saved 168 participating customers an average of 25 percent off their water bill and saved 1.9 million gallons of water. This figure is projected to exceed 1 billion gallons of water over a 10-year period when the program is fully deployed across more than 600 homes. The program utilizes irrigation control systems in individual homes to prevent over-watering.</p>
