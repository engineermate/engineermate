            <h4 id='美国国会投票降低饮用水中的铅含量'>美国国会投票降低饮用水中的铅含量</h4>
            <p>The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted 226-109 in favor of the "<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111s3874enr/pdf/BILLS-111s3874enr.pdf">Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act</a>," which the Senate also approved on a voice vote. The bill would set federal standards for levels of permissible lead in plumbing fixtures that carry drinking water, with the allowable lead content going from the current federal level of as much as 8 percent to 0.25 percent. If signed into law by President Obama, the bill will become effective 36 months later, and it then would prohibit manufacturers and importers from selling plumbing fixtures that don't meet the new standards.</p>

            <p>Yes, says green building and sustainability consultant Jerry Yudelson in his "<a href="http://www.greenbuildconsult.com/blog/">Top 10 Green Trends of 2011</a>." Due to awareness of the global freshwater crisis, building designers and managers will take more water-conservation steps, he says, including the use of more conservation-oriented fixtures, rainwater recovery systems, and innovative new water technologies.</p>

            <p>At least 74 million Americans in 42 states drink chromium-polluted tap water, much of it likely in the cancer-causing hexavalent form (the "Erin Brockovich" chemical), according to "<a href="http://static.ewg.org/reports/2010/chrome6/html/home.html">Cancer-causing Chromium-6 Pollution in U.S. Tap Water</a>." The highest levels are in Norman, Oklahoma, Honolulu, and Riverside, California. In all, water samples from 25 cities contained the toxic metal at concentrations above the safe maximum recently proposed by California regulators. Within 72 hours of the release of this report, the U.S. EPA <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/e77fdd4f5afd88a3852576b3005a604f/5876c7ed5950679385257801006be6bc!OpenDocument">announced new actions</a> to detect chromium-6 contamination in the nation's drinking water.</p>

            <p>During World Water Week (March 20-26, 2011), restaurants across the United States will encourage patrons to donate $1 or more for the tap water they usually enjoy for free as part of the UNICEF <a href="http://www.tapproject.org/">Tap Project</a>. All funds raised will support UNICEF's water, sanitation, and hygiene programs and the effort to bring clean and accessible water to millions of children around the world. Countries slated to receive 2011 funding include Vietnam, Togo, and the Central African Republic.</p>

            <p>A National Transportation Safety Board <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2010/101214.html">investigation</a> into the Sept. 9, 2010, <a href="http://www.baycitizen.org/san-bruno-explosion/">pipeline explosion</a> that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in San Bruno, California has found that the pipeline in the area of the rupture was constructed, at least in part, with seam-welded pipe, rather than 30-inch-diameter seamless steel pipe, which the utility company claims.</p>

            <p>The American Society of Sanitary Engineering is seeking input on the creation of a second white paper on the problems of scalding caused by improper or inadequate plumbing systems, specifically issues relating to improper temperature settings for residential water heaters. To participate in the Scald Awareness Task Group, you must complete an <a href="http://www.asse-plumbing.org/standards/Working%20Group%20App.pdf">application</a> and submit it to <a href="mailto:RJProspal@asse-plumbing.org">Richard Prospal</a>, chair of the group, by January 12, 2011.</p>
