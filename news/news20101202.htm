            <p>When graywater is reused, it has the potential to reduce the demand for new water supply, reduce the energy and carbon footprint of water services, and meet a wide range of social and economic needs, according to "<a href="http://www.pacinst.org/reports/greywater_overview/greywater_overview.pdf">Overview of Greywater Reuse: The Potential of Greywater Systems to Aid Sustainable Water Management</a>." This report discusses three categories of graywater treatment systems used around the world, including the technologies, costs, and land requirements of each type of system.</p>

            <p>The New York City Council recently enacted a set of local laws that address the water efficiency of New York City buildings by amending the New York City Plumbing Code. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/ll54of2010.pdf"> Local Law 54</a> prohibits the use of potable water for once-through cooling systems, and <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/ll56of2010.pdf"> Local Law 56</a> requires alarms and sub-meters to be installed in facilities that are major water users to alert both the operator of the facility and the Department of Environmental Protection of a potential water leak or equipment malfunction. Both are effective Jan. 1, 2011. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/ll55of2010.pdf"> Local Law 55</a> requires mandatory drinking fountains to be equipped with both a bubbler faucet for drinking and a separate faucet for filling a water bottle. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/ll57of2010.pdf"> Local Law 57</a> lowers the maximum flow rate for private lavatory faucets, showerheads, urinals, and toilets. They are effective July 1, 2012.</p>

            <p>This week, the Ontario Legislature passed the <a href="http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/water/opportunities/index.php">Water Opportunities and Water Conservation Act</a>,  which seeks to make Ontario a North American leader in developing water technologies through the creation of the Water Technology Acceleration Project, a technology hub bringing together industry, academics, and government to develop the sector and promote it abroad, the release stated. Legislators also passed the act to encourage Ontarians to use water more efficiently and to strengthen sustainable municipal water planning.</p>

            <p>Only 26 out of 53 African countries are on track to reach the UN's Millennium Development Goals target of halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to drinking water by 2015, according to the <a href="http://na.unep.net/atlas/africaWater/book.php">Africa Water Atlas</a>.  The report uses hundreds of before and after shots and satellite images to reveal the continent's water crisis.</p>

            <p>The U.S. EPA has introduced the country's first <a href="http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/ws_homes.html">WaterSense-labeled new homes</a> , which are independently inspected and certified to use 20 percent less water than typical new homes, saving about 10,000 gallons of water per year. In addition to efficient plumbing fixtures, these homes incorporate a hot water distribution system that decreases the amount of time it takes for hot water to reach the faucet or shower, and they feature water-efficient landscaping and irrigation.</p>

            <p>This week, Philippine House Bill 1296, the "Sewerage Systems and Wastewater and Septage Treatment Facility Act of 2010," was proposed in a bid to conserve and protect the water resources of the country. The bill mandates local government units to assist cities and municipalities in constructing a centralized sewerage system and a wastewater and septage treatment facility within five years upon enactment of the proposed act.

            <p>NSF International has launched <a href="http://www.nsf.org/business/flushability/index.asp?program=Flushability">the NSF Flushable Consumer Products Certification Program</a>,  which provides third-party verification of consumer product claims asserting they can be safely disposed of via toilet flushing. Certified flushable products will bear the "NSF Certified Flushable" Mark, which indicates whether certified products are suitable for a sewer system, a septic system, or both.</p>

            <p>Starting Oct. 3, 2011, the British Columbia Building Code will include a requirement for high-efficiency toilets (HETs) and urinals (HEUs) in new residential buildings or when renovations involving plumbing fixtures occur. HETs have a maximum flush volume of 4.8 liters. Dual-flush toilets are classified as HETs because the ratio of reduced flushes (up to 4.1 liters) to full flushes (up to 6 liters) results in an effective flush volume that is less than 4.8 liters. An HEU is a fixture with a flush volume of 1.9 liters or less. The requirement for toilets with a maximum flush cycle of 6 liters in industrial, commercial, and institutional buildings will remain unchanged.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2010/water.pdf">"Population, Immigration, and the Drying of the American Southwest"</a> explores the link between the potential water crisis and population growth in the U.S. Southwest. It looks at how the growth rate is driven by historically unprecedented immigration, legal and illegal, and presents evidence that indicates there is insufficient water for the region's current population, much less the larger future populations that will result if immigration continues at its present rate.</p>

            <p>The International Code Council has released the Version 2.0<http://www.iccsafe.org/igccv2> of the International Green Construction Code. Changes of note include a 20 percent water savings beyond U.S. federal standards for water closets in residential settings and a clarification of responsibilities from the registered design professional to the owner. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iccsafe.org/IGCC/PV2Development"> Code change proposals</a> for Version 2.0 are due by January 3.</p>
