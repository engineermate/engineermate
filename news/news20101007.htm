            <p>In addition to smoke alarms, President Obama lends his support to residential sprinkler systems as another measure to "give individuals extra time to evacuate a home safely," in the event of a fire, as he says in his 2010 Fire Prevention Week Proclamation.

            <p>Last week, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_2501-2550/ab_2514_bill_20100929_chaptered.pdf">AB 2514</a>, Energy Storage Systems into law. The bill requires electric utilities to adopt energy storage technologies, making it easier to incorporate renewable energy sources into the state's electric grid and allowing California's electric distribution system to meet and accommodate the ups and downs of energy demand.</p>

            <p>The amount of energy that the average American requires at home has changed little since the early 1970s, despite advances in technology that have made many home appliances far more energy efficient, according to an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/29/AR2010092906585.html">article</a> in The Washington Post. Why? American homes are getting bigger and bigger, requiring more energy to heat and cool, and the savings from energy-efficient appliances are being negated by energy-sucking devices such as flat-screen televisions.</p>

            <p>For the first time, federal estimates indicate that Lake Mead, the heart of the lower Colorado basin's water system, could drop below a crucial demarcation line of 1,075 feet, according to an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/science/earth/28mead.html?ref=earth">article</a> in The New York Times. If it does, a temporary distribution plan approved in 2007 by the seven states with claims to the river and by the federal Bureau of Reclamation will be put in motion, and water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada would be reduced.</p>

            <p>Methven Limited, a bathroom fittings manufacturer, has pleaded guilty to nine breaches of the New Zealand Fair Trading Act for misleading consumers about the potential savings gained when using its Satinjet shower product range and has been fined $50,000. The company's advertising campaign claimed that consumers could achieve significant hot water energy and total water use savings by installing a Satinjet showerhead with a 9- or 14-liter flow restrictor, compared with conventional showers. However, a Commerce Commission investigation found that approximately 60 percent of New Zealand showers already flow at a rate of 9 liters per minute or less, meaning those households would not have achieved any of the claimed savings by installing a Satinjet showerhead.</p>

            <p>According to Bradley's Healthy Handwashing Survey, Americans claim to wash their hands 89 percent of the time before leaving a public restroom as a result of the H1N1 virus. The top three reasons for not washing hands before leaving a public restroom are using a hand sanitizer instead, nonfunctioning sinks, and unclean sinks. 60 percent of Americans have had an unpleasant experience in a public restroom due to the condition of the facilities, particularly at a gas station or a public park.</p>

            <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wants to spend $1.5 billion over the next 20 years to reduce the flow of sewage into the city's waterways by building an infrastructure to capture and retain storm water using green roofs with plantings, porous pavement for parking lots, rain barrels, wetlands, and depressions for collecting water in parks to complement more traditional methods to control sewage overflows such as underground storage tanks and tunnel systems, according to an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/science/earth/29sewage.html?ref=earth">article</a> in The New York Times.</p>
            <h4 id='硝酸盐仍然是美国饮用水源的问题'>硝酸盐仍然是美国饮用水源的问题</h4>
            <p>Nitrate contamination is a continuing and relatively common problem for domestic wells that tap shallow groundwater, particularly in agricultural areas, according to a new U.S. Geological Survey <a href="">study</a>. Nitrate exceeds background concentrations in 64 percent of shallow wells (less than 100 feet). Concentrations were highest (median of 3.1 mg/L) in shallow wells in agricultural areas that are associated with high fertilizer and manure applications and lowest in shallow wells in urban areas (median of 1.4 mg/L) and in deep wells in major aquifers.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's<a href="http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/sustain/upload/Sustainability-Policy.pdf">Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy </a> aims to increase the sustainability of water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States. The policy emphasizes the need to build on existing efforts to promote sustainable water infrastructure. The policy also focuses on working with states and water systems to employ comprehensive planning processes that result in projects that are cost effective over their life cycle, resource efficient, and consistent with community sustainability goals.</p>
            <h4 id='全世界地下水枯竭率正在加剧'>全世界地下水枯竭率正在加剧</h4>
            <p>The rate at which global groundwater stocks are shrinking more than doubled between 1960 and 2000, increasing the amount lost from 126 to 283 cubic kilometers (30 to 68 cubic miles) of water per year, according to a recent <a href="http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2010/2010-30.shtml">global assessment of groundwater use</a>. Because the total amount of groundwater in the world is unknown, it's hard to say how fast the global supply would vanish at this rate, but if water was siphoned as rapidly from the Great Lakes, they would go bone-dry in approximately 80 years.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.iwa-pia.org/pia/2010Winners.aspx">Global Winners</a> of the International Water Association's Project Innovation Awards were recently announced. Winning projects include research on a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly ozone generation system, the sustainable life-cycle of polyethylene, recovery and use of water-based methane, creating premium tap water, and an environmentally friendly pretreatment for reverse osmosis in seawater desalinatio<a hrefn=""></a>.</p>
