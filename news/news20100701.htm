<h4 id='Washington Energy-efficiency Building Standards Delayed Indefinitely'>华盛顿州建筑物能耗标准无限期推迟</h4>	   
<p>Washington state's <a href="http://sbcc.wa.gov/Page.aspx?nid=138">new energy-efficiency building standard </a>swere set to go into effect today, 
but they have been delayed by at least three months. Governor Chris Gregoire asked the State Building Code Council to delay implementation of the 
standards to allow the state construction industry time to stabilize. The standards require builders to choose from among several measures to make 
homes environmentally friendly, such as by using high-efficiency furnaces or efficient insulation and windows. However, the Building Industry 
Association of Washington, which sued the state in May, claims that the standards exceed federal requirements and would add as much as $15,000 
to the price of a single-family home.</p>
	   
<h4 id='Did Your State Just Ban High-phosphate Dishwasher Detergent?'>你们州禁止在洗涤剂中过高的含磷量了没有?</h4>	   
<p>Starting today, it will be illegal for retailers in Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, 
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin to sell dishwasher detergents containing more than 0.5 percent 
phosphorus by weight. Although sewage treatment plants and private septic systems remove phosphate, a portion still makes its way into lakes 
and streams where it promotes algae growth and may degrade water quality.</p>
	   
<h4 id='Home Energy Conservation Act Introduced'>住宅节能法律提案出笼</h4>	   
<p>On Tuesday, Congressman Jim McDermott introduced H.R. 5617, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.5617:">Home Energy 
Conservation Bond Act</a>, which will authorize $2.4 billion in bonds to states and large municipalities to finance loans for residential 
energy-efficiency and water retrofits. The legislation would finance grants or low-interest loans for any property that meets (at a minimum) 
the requirements of the Energy Star program or the requirements of the Water Sense program or any property that is developed by a Residential 
Energy Services Network, Building Performance Institute, or equivalent, energy-efficiency expert and is certified (based on testing done before 
and after such improvements) as resulting in at least a 20 percent reduction in total household energy consumption related to heating, cooling, 
lighting, and appliances.</p>
	   
<h4 id='EPA Seeks Comments on Proposed Drinking Water Regulation Changes'>EPA 征求对饮用水修改稿的意见</h4>	   
<p>The U.S. EPA is proposing <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/disinfection/tcr/regulation.html#tcr1989">revisions</a> to the 1989 Total 
Coliform Rule (TCR), a national primary drinking water regulation. The purpose of the TCR is to protect public health by ensuring the integrity 
of drinking water distribution systems and monitoring for the presence of microbial contamination, and the new revisions would help achieve 
reater public health protection against waterborne pathogens in the distribution systems of public water systems. The proposed revisions to 
the TCR will require public water systems that are vulnerable to microbial contamination to identify and fix problems and establish criteria 
for systems to qualify for and stay on reduced monitoring, thereby providing incentives for improved water system operation.</p>
	   
<h4 id='Water Is a Top 5 Concern Among Businesses'>水是第五个最被关切的行业</h4>	   
<p>According to Unlocking the Profit in Water Savings, water stewardship is one of the top five business concerns among 52 percent of 
sustainability professionals, and 99 percent of these professionals believe that water will become more of a priority for businesses in the 
next five to 10 years. The report also discusses specific water-efficiency measures taken by various companies and details the associated 
returns on investment. The measures that have the largest effect on the companies’ water use and costs are recycling or reusing water, measuring 
and reporting water use, and using technical solutions to increase water efficiency.

<h4 id='Which Country Has the Highest Water Security Risk?'>哪一个国家的饮用水安全最差?</h4>	   
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.maplecroft.com/about/news/water-security.html">Water Security Risk Index</a>, Somalia, Mauritania, 
Sudan, Niger, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Turkmenistan, and Syria are the countries with the least secure supplies of water, based on 
their supply of clean, fresh water to citizens and businesses. The study measured four key areas surrounding the issue: access to improved 
drinking water and sanitation, availability of renewable water and reliance on external supplies, the relationship between available water and 
supply demands, and the water dependency of each country's economy. The countries with the most stable supplies of clean water are Iceland, Norway, 
and New Zealand. The United States was ranked a medium risk country, ranking 104 on the list of 165 nations.</p>
	   
<h4 id='UL Announces Improved Testing Methods for Detecting and Analyzing Emerging Contaminants in Drinking Water'>UL 宣布检测和分析饮用水中新出现
的污染物的改进方法</h4>	   
<p>Underwriters Laboratories has developed two new methods to test water supplies for emerging contaminants. UL combined its existing methods to 
develop UL L222, which focuses on detecting and analyzing nearly 30 of the most frequently studied and detected contaminants of emerging concern, 
including acetaminophen, bisphenol A, caffeine, DEET, estrone, nicotine, nonylphenol, and triclosan. It also streamlined the analysis of selected 
semi-volatile organic compounds including sterols, phosphate flame retardants, fragrances, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, and pesticides to 
create UL S190.  Both testing methods are used to analyze contaminants of emerging concern found in treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, 
and municipal drinking water.</p>
	   
<h4 id='China Releases a Plan to Protect Drinking Water in Urban Areas'>中国城市饮用水水源地环境保护规划出台</h4>	   
<p>China’s Urban Drinking Water Sources Protection Plan will guide environmental protection and pollution control work at drinking-water source 
areas by removing illegal buildings, drain outlets, dump sites, and factories from such areas and banning activities that may pollute the water in 
the protected areas, such as fish farming, swimming, and fishing. The $8.5 billion plan also will help control water pollution caused by farming, 
animal husbandry, and water transportation; launch ecological restoration projects at protected areas; and enhance monitoring and emergency response 
systems for water quality control and management.</p>
	   
<h4 id='EPA Announces a New Program to Green the Nation’s Capitals'>EPA宣布美国各州首府绿色新规划</h4>	   
<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/greencapitals.htm">Greening America's Capitals </a>is a project of the Partnership for Sustainable 
Communities between EPA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Transportation to help state capitals 
develop an implementable vision of distinctive, environmentally friendly neighborhoods that incorporate innovative green building and green 
infrastructure strategies. This program will assist three to four communities per year, with the first projects beginning in the fall. These pilot 
communities could be the testing ground for citywide actions, such as changes to local codes and ordinances to better support sustainable growth 
and green building.</p>
