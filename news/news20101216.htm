        <p>A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution biologist has developed a <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=7545&tid=282&cid=86848&ct=162">Swimming Behavioral Spectrophotometer</a>, which employs one-celled protozoa to detect toxins in water sources. The technique works by introducing protozoa into small chambers with water samples taken from municipal, industrial, or military water sources and comparing them to control samples. Any alteration of the protozoa's swimming mechanics is a sign that water conditions have changed and chemical or biological contaminants-pesticides, industrial chemicals, or biological warfare agents-may be present. Commercial applications for the technology include monitoring of industrial wastewater discharge, and the security and quality of drinking water supplies.</p>

        <p>As a result of water cases concluded in fiscal year 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 1 billion pounds of water pollution per year will be reduced, eliminated, or properly managed, according to its <a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/reports/endofyear/eoy2010/index.html">annual enforcement and compliance results</a>. Also in 2010, the EPA took enforcement and compliance actions that required polluters to pay more than $110 million in civil penalties and commit to spend an estimated $12 billion on pollution controls, cleanup, and environmental projects that benefit communities.</p>

        <p>At the Arizona Snowbowl, fake snow on the San Francisco Peaks will be made using treated wastewater bought from the city of Flagstaff. A coalition of environmentalists and citizens had sued the U.S. Forest Service to force the agency to do a more thorough environmental assessment on the health and safety risks of using treated wastewater as artificial snow, but a federal judge recently ruled in favor of the Forest Service, which says that while the use of reclaimed water for snowmaking is not considered hazardous for recreational skiing and snow play, signs will be posted to urge people not to intentionally ingest snow.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Southeast, much like the Southwest, does not have enough water capacity to meet its municipal, agricultural, and industrial needs, or its virtual water footprint, according to "<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/50/21263.full.pdf">Reclaiming Freshwater Sustainability in the Cadillac Desert</a>." The problem is exacerbated by recent droughts and loss of reservoir storage capacity due to sedimentation and evaporation.</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday, in a 26-count <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/December/10-enrd-1409.html">indictment</a> returned by a federal grand jury, United Water Services Inc. and two employees were charged with manipulating daily wastewater sampling methods, which is a felony violation of the Clean Water Act, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. United Water <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101208006986/en/United-Water-Refutes-DOJ-Charges">refutes the charges</a>.</p>

        <p>Asian researchers now lead the world in patent activity related to nanofiltration, the most-researched method of water filtration, according to <a href="http://www.cas.org/ASSETS/279B0C10D81043FF8729A21429A028D0/CASChemRepFINAL10112010.pdf">CAS Chemistry Research Report: Nanofiltration Shows Promise in the Quest for Pure Water</a>. The report found that in the quest to counter water scarcity, Asian researchers have issued 60 percent of all nanofiltration patents over the last 20 years, with China issuing 33 percent of all patents, followed by Japan and Korea, issuing 16 and 10 percent respectively. The United States leads in the publication of scholarly research on nanofiltration, issuing 25 percent of all research journal literature between 1990 and 2009.</p>

        <p>The Plumbing Efficiency Research Coalition (PERC) and the Australasian Scientific Review of Reduction of Flows on Plumbing and Drainage Systems Committee signed a <a href="http://iapmo.org/Press%20Releases/2010-11-29%20PERC%20Australasian%20Scientific%20Flow%20MoU.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> to collaborate on research programs that seek to investigate the impact of reduced water flows in sanitary drainage systems resulting from reductions in water use from plumbing fixtures and fittings, appliances, and commercial and institutional equipment.</p>
