Dear Mr. Gao,

I did not include CA in my book. If you or your colleagues have the membership of ASPE (American Society of Plumbing Engineers), you may have its DATA Books. Chapter 9 in Data Book 3 (2006-2007 edition) is on compressed air. If you go to its Website, www.aspe.org, you may get more information.

Follow the main points below to design your lab system:
1. Calculate the air demand by lab outlets: 1 SCFM (or Standard cubic meter per minute) per outlet; use diversity factor to get the total demand of the outlets.
2. Add demand by equipment: Refer to equipment catalog cuts to get the demand in SCFM and pressure.
3. Use the total and pressure to size the air compressor.
4. Provide separate system with different pressure requirement or use PRV (pressure reducing valve).
5. Use charts, tables, or programs in Fluid Mechanics to calculate the pipe size.

I am developing a package for plumbing system design, including lab gases. If you are interested, I will let you know when it is ready for sale.

By the way, in the June issue of ASPE's SPD magazine you may see my fifth article: Sizing Roof Area.

Hope the above will be helpful.

Anjian
